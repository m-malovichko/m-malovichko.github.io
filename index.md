I am Mikhail Malovichko, PhD, a Senior Geophysicist at Aramco Innovations, Thrust Champion of the HPC Team.

My areas of expertise are mathematical modelling, high-performance computing, inverse problems, and software
development with applications to geophysics, including:

* geophysical modelling/inverse problems/imaging:
acoustic/elastic/fluid-solid seismic simulation, elastic
FWI, elastic RTM, LS-RTM, Hessian approximations,
borehole sonic logging, electromagnetic modelling and
inversion, multi-physics inversion, potential fields;

* multidimensional PDE-based inverse problems, optimal control, imaging;

* high-performance computing, MPI, OpenMP, CUDA;

* numerical methods for PDEs (FEM, mixed FEM, Discontinuous Galerkin, spectral elements, finite volume
method, finite differences, multigrid, etc)

* computational linear algebra, Krylov solvers, saddle-point problems, preconditioning,multigrid, non-linear problems, optimization;
